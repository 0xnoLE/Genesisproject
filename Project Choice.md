# Project Choice

Project Overview: Build a web platform that aggregates public data (like census, environmental, or traffic data) and presents it in an engaging, interactive format to tell stories about community issues, growth, and changes.

This should read liike a blog so it can properly fit in the Jekkyl format hosted by Github.


Let's start brainstorming an outline:

Skills Involved:
- Data analysis
- web development
- interactive data visualization (e.g., using D3.js or Leaflet for maps).

Objectives:
- Gather snapshot of data from public sources
- Aggregate Data w/ transparent calculations
- Visualize & Prettify Data for unique insights
- Have corresponding analysis for display
- Style analysis for future use

Software Development Framework(s):
- React + Redux
- Vue.js
- Angular
- Svelte
- Next.js
- Jekyll

I Think making a site that's staatic initially would make for a much easier site to display. We also would only have to worry about a single snapshot of data rather than creating an API from scratch to continuously query.

GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll making it an out-of-the-box solution!

Now that we've gotten the project choice and premier framework out the way, let's get to building!
