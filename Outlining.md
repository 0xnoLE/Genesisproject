Outlining

Fornt -> Back -> Middle

Remember, that's how we're doing this. The good news is, we already have a lot of the middle completed! It's aggregating and properly storing data taken from open sources. Now that I think about it...housing the data may be a bit more complicated than I thought.

Anyways... let's start with the front-end!


## Front-End

The front-end should be a simple static site, simiarly to a blog where there are a few simple components:
- Pictures/Figures (Data)
- Dataframes/Tables where data can be put on display
- Space for paragraph based text
- Area for advertisements!
- Button's that allow you to switch from page to page of submissions.
- Comment section?



This is what we would typically shoot for on a custom-built front-end. How about if we decided to make it via Jekyll?

Features of Jekyll

- Simple!
- Easy integration with Github Pages. It's natively supported!
- Liquid Templating Engine
- Markdown Support
- Static Site Performance
- Plugins & Tehmes
- Data File Support (YAML, JSON, CSV)
- Customizable Build Process


Limitations of Jekyll
- Ruby Environment requirement (Barrier to entry)
- Build Speed (Scalability)
- Lack of dynamic content
- Limited CMS Options
- Learning Curve for Liquid & Jekyll Structure
- Limited Plugin Availability

Are we sure we want to use Jekyll? Maybe from here we can branch off into alternatives.
